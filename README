KNNL

Kohonen Neural Network Library

This library is written in C++, using boost library.
To compile is needed boost version 1.33 or newer.

In special case it is possble to reduce code and force 
to use library without boost. 

For details look on http://knnl.sourceforge.net.

To compile demo version run:

make 

or 

make release

for debugging use

make debug

or to prepare release version with logger - trivial debugger 
described in debbugger.hpp file:

make tdrelease

There are also included project files for MS Visual Studio and
Dev C++. However they assume that Boost library is installed in:
C:/Boost. If this path is different fix the options, please.

Have a fun :-),
Authors.
